# Limitations of single population ODE models

- As discussed in [Lecture 03](https://julien-arino.github.io/3MC-course-epidemiological-modelling/2022_04_3MC_EpiModelling_L03_SpreadInGroups_SpreadInSpace.html), basic ODE assume that all individuals in a compartment are roughly the same
- Individuals can spend differing times in a compartment (see [Lecture 09](https://julien-arino.github.io/3MC-course-epidemiological-modelling/2022_04_3MC_EpiModelling_L09_RecentMathematicalModels.html)), but they are all the same
- As we have seen with COVID-19, different age groups are impacted differently

---

# Groups can be used for many things

Groups allow to introduce structure in a population without using PDEs

- Age structure
- Social structure
- Pathogen heterogeneity
- Host heterogeneity (e.g., super spreaders)

In this lecture, we do not consider *spatial heterogeity*; this is done in [Lecture 05](https://julien-arino.github.io/3MC-course-epidemiological-modelling/2022_04_3MC_EpiModelling_L05_MetapopulationModels.html)

We start by considering a few examples

# Age-structured models

---

# First, a remark

In terms of modelling, ODEs are not the best way to incorporate structure such as age. We will come back to this in [Lecture 09](https://julien-arino.github.io/3MC-course-epidemiological-modelling/2022_04_3MC_EpiModelling_L09_RecentMathematicalModels.html), but give one example here

# <!--fit-->[A multi-group SIS model with age structure](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jde.2004.10.009), by Feng, Huang & C$^3$

For $i=1,\ldots,n$ different subgroups
$$
\begin{align*}

-\mu_i(a)S_i(t,a)-\Lambda_i(a,I(t,\cdot))S_i(t,a)+\gamma_i(a)I_i(t,a) \\
\left(
\frac{\partial}{\partial t}+\frac{\partial}{\partial a}
\right)I_i
&= 
-\mu_i(a)I_i(t,a)+\Lambda_i(a,I(t,\cdot))S_i(t,a)-\gamma_i(a)I_i(t,a)
\end{align*}
$$
where
$$
\Lambda_i(a,I(\cdot,t)):=K_i(a)I_i(a,t)+\sum_{j=1}^n
\int_0^\omega K_{ij}(a,s)I_j(s,t)\ ds

with boundary and initial conditions, for $i=1,\ldots,n$

$$
\begin{align*}
S_i(t,0) &= \int_0^\omega b_i(a)[S_i(t,a)+(1-q_i)I_i(t,a)]\ da \\
I_i(t,0) &= q_i\int_0^\omega b_i(a)I_i(t,a)\ da,\quad 0<q_1<1 \\
S_i(0,a) &= \psi(a) \\
I_i(0,a) &= \varphi(a)
\end{align*}
$$
($q_i$ fraction of newborns that is infected)

Basic reproduction number in group $i=1,\ldots,n$
$$
\mathcal{R}_i = \int_0^\omega b_i(a)\exp\left(
-\int_0^a \mu_i(\tau)d\tau
\right)\ da
$$

- Authors obtain some results in terms of global stability
- Need simplifications to move forward
- No numerics, because numerics for such models are *hard*

---

# Going the ODE route

- ODEs are way less satisfactory but can be used as-is and are much easier numerically
- **Caveat -** ODE models with age structure are *intrinsically wrong*, since sojourn times in an age group is exponentially distributed instead of Dirac distributed! (See [Lecture 09](https://julien-arino.github.io/3MC-course-epidemiological-modelling/2022_04_3MC_EpiModelling_L09_RecentMathematicalModels.html))

Preventing tuberculosis in the foreign-born population of Canada: a mathematical modelling study.  Varughese, Langlois-Klassen, Long, & Li. [International Journal of Tuberculosis and Lung Disease](https://doi.org/10.5588/ijtld.13.0625) **18** (2014)

- New immigrants from Canada come predominantly from countries in which TB is very active
- It has been noticed that people develop TB in the first few years of their presence in CAN
- Want to investigate this, together with effect of various screening measures

- Consider what happens when a new variant N arrives in a situation where another variant O is already circulating

# Coupling is through the force of infection

- For now, we have discussed *incidence functions* $f(S,I,N)$
- Here, we use a *force of infection* $\Phi_X$, for $X\in\{O,N\}$
- Force of infection uses $S$ "outside" of function: it is the pressure that applies to $S$ individuals to make them infected
- Of course, the two are equivalent, but in some contexts, it makes sense to use this
- Here, for $X\in\{O,N\}$
$$
\Phi_X = \beta_X(\eta_{X}L_{X_C2}+\xi_X(D_{X_C1}+D_{X_C2})+U_{X_C1}+U_{X_C2})
$$

---

# Adding more groups - "Importation layer"

- How can we evaluate how much "importations" contribute to propagation within a location?
- If an individual arrives in a new location while bearing the disease, we put them in a special group, the *importation layer*
- In importation layer, individuals make contacts with others in the population, but they remain in the importation layer until recovery or death

# Force of infection with importation layer

For $X\in\{O,N\}$
$$
\Phi_X = \Phi_{X_I}+\Phi_{X_I}
$$
where, for $X\in\{O,N\}$ and $Z\in\{I,C\}$

$$
\Phi_{X_Z} = \beta_X(\eta_{X}L_{X_Z2}+\xi_X(D_{X_Z1}+D_{X_Z2})+U_{X_Z1}+U_{X_Z2})
$$

# Models with immunological component

Global dynamics of a general class of multistage models for infectious diseases. Guo, Li & Shuai. [SIAM Journal on Applied Mathematics](https://doi.org/10.1137/110827028) **72** (2012)

- Viruses such as HIV reside in the body for a very long time, potentially for life
- Throughout the course of this residence, virus loads change and with it symptoms and infectiousness

# Model of Guo, Li & Shuai

- For general considerations about a method, see Lu & Shuai, [Global-stability problem for coupled systems of differential equations on networks](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jde.2009.09.003), *JDE* **248** (2010)
- Techniques use combination of "classical" ODE stability theory, linear algebra and graph theory
- They show GAS when $\mathcal{R}_0\leq 1$ and GAS under conditions when $\mathcal{R}_0>1$
- Use Lyapunov function $L=\sum_{i=1}^nw_iI_i$ for DFE when $\mathcal{R}_0\leq 1$
- For EEP, use a Goh type Lyapunov function
$$
V=\tau_1
\int_{S^*}^{S}
\dfrac{\Phi(\xi)-\Phi(S^*)}{\Phi(\xi)}d\xi
+\sum_{i=1}^n
\tau_i
\int_{I_i^*}^{I_i}
\dfrac{\psi(\xi)-\psi(I_i^*)}{\psi(\xi)}d\xi
$$
- Use Kirchhoff’s matrix tree theorem to show that $V'$ is negative definite

- This is very similar to metapopulation models which are described in [Practicum 02](https://julien-arino.github.io/3MC-course-epidemiological-modelling/2022_04_3MC_EpiModelling_P02_Analysis_LargeScaleModels.html)
- The variant importation model simulations will be discussed in the stochastic lectures
