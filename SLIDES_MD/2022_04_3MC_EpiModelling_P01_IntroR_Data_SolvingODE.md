# R was originally for stats but is now more

- Open source version of S
- Appeared in 1993
- Now version 4.1
- One major advantage in my view: uses a lot of C and Fortran code. E.g., `deSolve`:
> The functions provide an interface to the FORTRAN functions 'lsoda', 'lsodar', 'lsode', 'lsodes' of the 'ODEPACK' collection, to the FORTRAN functions 'dvode', 'zvode' and 'daspk' and a C-implementation of solvers of the 'Runge-Kutta' family with fixed or variable time steps
- Very active community on the web, easy to find solutions (same true of Python, I just prefer R)

---

# Development environments

- Terminal version, not very friendly
- Nicer terminal: [radian](https://github.com/randy3k/radian)
- Execute R scripts by using `Rscript name_of_script.R`. Useful to run code in `cron`, for instance
- Use IDEs:
    - [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/) has become the reference
    - [RKWard](https://invent.kde.org/education/rkward) is useful if you are for instance using an ARM processor (Raspberry Pi, some Chromebooks..)
- Integrate into jupyter notebooks

---

# Going further

- [RStudio server](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/#rstudio-server): run RStudio on a Linux server and connect via a web interface
- Shiny: easily create an interactive web site running R code
- [Shiny server](https://www.rstudio.com/products/shiny/shiny-server/): run Shiny apps on a Linux server
- Rmarkdown: markdown that incorporates R commands. Useful for generating reports in html or pdf, can make slides as well..
- RSweave: LaTeX incorporating R commands. Useful for generating reports. Not used as much as Rmarkdown these days

---

# R is a scripted language

- Interactive
- Allows you to work in real time
    - Be careful: what is in memory might involve steps not written down in a script
    - If you want to reproduce your steps, it is good to write all the steps down in a script and to test from time to time running using `Rscript`: this will ensure that all that is required to run is indeed loaded to memory when it needs to, i.e., that it is not already there..

# <!--fit-->Programming in R

---

# Similar to matlab..

.. with some differences, of course! Otherwise, where would the fun be? ;)

---

# Assignment

Two ways:

```
X <- 10
```

or

```
X = 10
```

First version is preferred by R purists.. I don't really care

---

# Lists

A very useful data structure, quite flexible and versatile. Empty list: `L <- list()`. Convenient for things like parameters. For instance

```
L <- list()
L$a <- 10
L$b <- 3
L[["another_name"]] <- "Plouf plouf"
```

```
> L[1]
$a
[1] 10
> L[[2]]
[1] 3
> L$a
[1] 10
> L[["b"]]
[1] 3
> L$another_name
[1] "Plouf plouf"
```

---

# Vectors

```
x = 1:10
y <- c(x, 12)
> y
 [1]  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 12
z = c("red", "blue")
> z
[1] "red"  "blue"
z = c(z, 1)
> z
[1] "red"  "blue" "1"
```
Note that in `z`, since the first two entries are characters, the added entry is also a character. Contrary to lists, vectors have all entries of the same type

---

# Matrices

Matrix (or vector) of zeros
```
A <- mat.or.vec(nr = 2, nc = 3)
```

Matrix with prescribed entries

```
B <- matrix(c(1,2,3,4), nr = 2, nc = 2)
> B
     [,1] [,2]
[1,]    1    3
[2,]    2    4
C <- matrix(c(1,2,3,4), nr = 2, nc = 2, byrow = TRUE)
> C
     [,1] [,2]
[1,]    1    2
[2,]    3    4
```

Remark that here and elsewhere, naming the arguments (e.g., `nr = 2`) allows to use arguments in any order

---

# Matrix operations

Probably the biggest annoyance in R compared to other languages

- The notation `A*B` is the *Hadamard product* $A\circ B$ (what would be denoted `A.*B` in matlab), not the standard matrix multiplication
- Matrix multiplication is written `A %*% B`

---

# Vector operations

Vector addition is also frustrating. Say you write `x=1:10`, i.e., make the vector
```
> x
 [1]  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10
```
Then `x+1` gives
```
> x+1
 [1]  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11
 ```
 i.e., adds 1 to all entries in the vector

 Beware of this in particular when addressing sets of indices in lists, vectors or matrices

---

# For the matlab-ers here

- R does not have the keyword `end` to access the last entry in a matrix/vector/list..
- Use `length` (lists or vectors), `nchar` (character chains), `dim` (matrices.. careful, of course returns 2 values)

---

# Flow control

```
if (condition is true) {
  list of stuff to do
}
```

Even if `list of stuff to do` is a single instruction, best to use curly braces

```
if (condition is true) {
  list of stuff to do
} else if (another condition) {
  ...
} else {
  ...
}
```

---

# For loops

`for` applies to lists or vectors

```
for (i in 1:10) {
  something using integer i
}
for (j in c(1,3,4)) {
  something using integer j
}
for (n in c("truc", "muche", "chose")) {
  something using string n
}
for (m in list("truc", "muche", "chose", 1, 2)) {
  something using string n or integer n, depending
}
```

---

# lapply

Very useful function (a few others in the same spirit: `sapply`, `vapply`, `mapply`)

Applies a function to each entry in a list/vector/matrix

Because there is a parallel version (`parLapply`) that we will see later, worth learning

```
l = list()
for (i in 1:10) {
        l[[i]] = runif(i)
}
lapply(X = l, FUN = mean)
```

or, to make a vector

```
unlist(lapply(X = l, FUN = mean))
```

or

```
sapply(X = l, FUN = mean)
```

---

# "Advanced" lapply

Can "pick up" nontrivial list entries

```
l = list()
for (i in 1:10) {
        l[[i]] = list()
        l[[i]]$a = runif(i)
        l[[i]]$b = runif(2*i)
}
sapply(X = l, FUN = function(x) length(x$b))
```

gives

```
[1]  2  4  6  8 10 12 14 16 18 20
```

Just recall: the argument to the function you define is a list entry (`l[[1]]`, `l[[2]]`, etc., here)

---

# Avoid parameter variation loops with expand.grid

```
# Suppose we want to vary 3 parameters
variations = list(
    p1 = seq(1, 10, length.out = 10),
    p2 = seq(0, 1, length.out = 10),
    p3 = seq(-1, 1, length.out = 10)
)

# Create the list
tmp = expand.grid(variations)
PARAMS = list()
for (i in 1:dim(tmp)[1]) {
    PARAMS[[i]] = list()
    for (k in 1:length(variations)) {
        PARAMS[[i]][[names(variations)[k]]] = tmp[i, k]     
    }
}
```

There is still a loop, but you can split this list, use it on different machines, etc. And can use `parLapply`

# It is important to be "data aware"

- Using R (or Python), it is really easy to grab data from the web, e.g., from Open Data sources
- More and more locations have an open data policy
- As a modeller, you do not need to have data everywhere, but you should be aware of the context
- If you want your work to have an impact, for instance in public health, you cannot be completely disconnected from reality

---

# Data is everywhere 

## Closed data

- Often generated by companies, governments or research labs
- When available, come with multiple restrictions

## Open data

- Often generated by the same entities but "liberated" after a certain period
- More and more frequent with governments/public entities
- Wide variety of licenses, so beware
- Wide variety of qualities, so beware

---

# Open Data initiatives

Recent movement (5-10 years): governments (local or higher) create portals where data are centralised and published

# Computation of root systems interactions

(Needs a relatively large machine here - about 50GB RAM)

- If roots of an infected tree touch roots of a susceptible tree, fungus is transmitted
- Spread of a tree's root system depends on its height (we have diametre at breast height, DBH, for all trees)
- The way roadways are built, there cannot be contacts between root systems of trees on opposite sides of a street

---

# Distances between all trees

```
elms_xy = cbind(elms$X, elms$Y)
D = dist(elms_xy)
idx_D = which(D<50)
```

`indices_LT` is a large $N(N-1)/2\times 2$ matrix with indices (orig,dest) of trees in the pairs of elms, so `indices_LT[idx_D]` are the pairs under consideration

Keep a little more..

```
indices_LT_kept = as.data.frame(cbind(indices_LT[idx_D,],
                                D[idx_D]))
colnames(indices_LT_kept) = c("i","j","dist")
```

---

# Create line segments between all pairs of trees

                       elms_latlon$lat[indices_LT_kept$i])

# Data wrangling: `dplyr` vs `sqldf`

`dplyr` is part of the `tidyverse` set of libraries. Load `magrittr` and its pipe `%>%`

`sqldf` allows to use SQL on dataframes.. interesting alternative if you know SQL

# The deSolve library

- As I have already pointed out, [`deSolve`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/deSolve/index.html):
> The functions provide an interface to the FORTRAN functions 'lsoda', 'lsodar', 'lsode', 'lsodes' of the 'ODEPACK' collection, to the FORTRAN functions 'dvode', 'zvode' and 'daspk' and a C-implementation of solvers of the 'Runge-Kutta' family with fixed or variable time steps

- So you are benefiting from years and year of experience: [ODEPACK](https://computing.llnl.gov/projects/odepack) is a set of Fortran (77!) solvers developed at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL) starting in the late 70s

- Other good solvers are also included, those written in C

- Refer to the [package help](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/deSolve/deSolve.pdf) for details

---

# Using deSolve for simple ODEs

As with more numerical solvers, you need to write a function returning the value of the right hand side of your equation (the vector field) at a given point in phase space, then call this function from the solver

```
library(deSolve)
rhs_logistic <- function(t, x, p) {
  with(as.list(x), {
    dN <- p$r * N *(1-N/p$K)
    return(list(dN))
  })
}
params = list(r = 0.1, K = 100)
IC = c(N = 50)
times = seq(0, 100, 1)
sol <- ode(IC, times, rhs_logistic, params)
```

---

This also works: add `p` to arguments of `as.list` and thus use without `p$` prefix

```
library(deSolve)
rhs_logistic <- function(t, x, p) {
  with(as.list(c(x, p)), {
    dN <- r * N *(1-N/K)
    return(list(dN))
  })
}
params = list(r = 0.1, K = 100)
IC = c(N = 50)
times = seq(0, 100, 1)
sol <- ode(IC, times, rhs_logistic, params)
```

In this case, beware of not having a variable and a parameter with the same name..

---

# Default method: `lsoda`

- `lsoda` switches automatically between stiff and nonstiff methods

- You can also specify other methods: "lsode", "lsodes", "lsodar", "vode", "daspk", "euler", "rk4", "ode23", "ode45", "radau", "bdf", "bdf_d", "adams", "impAdams" or "impAdams_d" ,"iteration" (the latter for discrete-time systems)

```
ode(y, times, func, parms, 
    method = "ode45")
```

- You can even implement your own integration method

---

# Example - Fitting to data

- Note that this is a super simplified version of what to do
- Much more elaborate procedures exist
  - Roda. [Bayesian inference for dynamical systems](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.idm.2019.12.007)
  - Portet. [A primer on model selection using the Akaike Information Criterion](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.idm.2019.12.010)
- Let us grab some epi data online and fit an SIR model to it
- Don't expect anything funky, as I said, this is the baby version
- Also, keep in mind that any identification procedure is subject to risks due to *identifiability issues*; see, e.g., Roda et al, [Why is it difficult to accurately predict the COVID-19 epidemic?](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.idm.2020.03.001)

# Principle

- Data is a set $(t_i,y_i)$, $i=1,\ldots,N$, where $t_i\in\mathcal{I}$, some interval
- Solution to SIR is $(t,x(t))$ for $t\in\mathcal{I}$
- Suppose parameters of the model are $p$
- We want to minimise the error function
$$
E(p) = \sum_{i=1}^N \|x(t_i)-y_i\|
$$
- Norm is typically Euclidean, but could be different depending on objectives
- So given a point $p$ in (admissible) parameter space, we compute the solution to the ODE, compute $E(p)$
- Using some minimisation algorithm, we seek a minimum of $E(p)$ by varying $p$

# What are $y_i$ and $x(t_i)$ here?

- In epi data for infectious diseases, we typically have incidence, i.e., number of new cases per unit time
- In SIR model, this is $\beta SI$, so, if using incidence and Euclidean norm
$$
E(p)=\sum_{i=1}^N(\beta S(t_i)I(t_i)-y_i)^2
$$
