# Two example data sets

The two datasets here were created by me some time back and are part of a [public repo](https://github.com/julien-arino/datasets):
- [measles_reportedCases_USA_from1944.csv]() is assembled from the CDC reported cases of measles. Early data was gathered from the MMWR summaries, while recent data is collected from a [specific page](https://www.cdc.gov/measles/cases-outbreaks.html) on the CDC website. Some remarks about gathering the data and making figures can be found [here](https://julien-arino.github.io/blog/2018/US-measles-cases/) and [here](https://julien-arino.github.io/blog/2018/US-plotting-nice-axes-and-cropping/).
- [SARS-CoV-1_data.csv]() was assembled from WHO reports on the spread of SARS-CoV-1 in 2003. The methodology used to assemble the data is explained [here](https://julien-arino.github.io/blog/2014/SARS-data/).
